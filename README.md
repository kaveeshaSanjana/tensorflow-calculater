# Hand Gesture Arithmetic Calculator

An AI-powered calculator that interprets hand gestures via webcam and performs arithmetic operations in real-time.

## Overview

This project is a web-based tool that uses **TensorFlow.js** and **Vanilla JavaScript** to recognize hand gestures representing numbers and basic arithmetic operators. It then computes and displays the result – no keyboard or mouse needed!

### Ideal For:
- Students learning math interactively
- Individuals with physical disabilities
- Anyone interested in AI and gesture-based interfaces

---

## Features

-  Real-time hand gesture recognition
-  Supports basic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
-  Web-based & cross-platform
-  Lightweight interface with fast performance
-  Powered by TensorFlow.js for ML processing

---

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript**
- **HTML/CSS**
- **TensorFlow.js**

## How It Works

1. Load the app on a browser with webcam access.
2. Show hand gestures for numbers (0-9) and operators (+, -, ×, ÷).
3. The system detects and converts them into arithmetic expressions.
4. Result is displayed instantly!
